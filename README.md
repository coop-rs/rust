## Cooperative allocation for Rust

See https://github.com/coop-rs/rust/wiki. Please, share any relevant insight.

Currently, development is done on branch [vec_mvp_2](https://github.com/coop-rs/rust/tree/vec_mvp_2).
However, this branch is rebased on [rust-lang/rust](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust)'s master (every few days). It will (hopefully) be disected/separated into two nbranches. Hence, if you'd like to fork [coop-rs/rust](https://github.com/coop-rs/rust), or create pull requests, please connect first.

This document exists on `intro` branch only. This branch does NOT contain any related source/commits.
